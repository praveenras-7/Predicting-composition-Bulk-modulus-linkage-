Predicting bulk modulus property using the techniques of materials informatics
The combined application of informatics and material science are explored. The data containing 83989 compositions are extracted from Materials database after cleansing the extracted data, the linkage between composition and the bulk modulus property are predicted with the technique of Composition Based Feature Vector (CBFV) by using suitable Classical Machine Learning Algorithms and further with a Deep neural network.
